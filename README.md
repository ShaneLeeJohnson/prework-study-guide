# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide to help not only myself, but anyone who might be going through the UTSA Coding Bootcamp Prework and needs an organized place to review notes for each topic they learned. The 4 sections covered are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I will continue to update this Study Guide as I continue to learn more about each of these topics.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide contains notes organized into 4 sections. HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can review notes about each topic on your own, or if your having trouble with which topic to study first, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I on macOS or Control+Shift+I on Windows. A console panel will open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. In the console you will see a list of topics that we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. You can refresh the webpage to get a different suggestion.
